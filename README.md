Chatbot App Using Spring Boot, React JS, and ChatGPT API – Theory (10–12 Points)
Project Overview:
This project is a full-stack chatbot application that allows users to interact with an AI-powered bot using OpenAI's ChatGPT API. It combines Spring Boot for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and uses the ChatGPT API to handle chatbot responses.

Technology Stack:

Backend: Spring Boot (Java)

Frontend: React.js

API Integration: ChatGPT (OpenAI API)

Communication: RESTful APIs

Spring Boot (Backend):

Handles business logic and API routing.

Exposes endpoints to receive user messages and relay them to ChatGPT.

Manages secure API communication with OpenAI using HTTP requests.

Uses standard controllers (@RestController) and CORS settings to enable frontend communication.

React JS (Frontend):

Provides a clean user interface for chatting with the bot.

Captures user input and displays chatbot responses dynamically.

Uses Axios or Fetch API to call the backend endpoints.

Styled with basic CSS or a component library (e.g., Bootstrap or Material-UI).

ChatGPT API Integration:

The backend sends user messages to OpenAI's /v1/chat/completions endpoint.

The OpenAI API processes the input and returns a response generated by GPT.

Requires an API key from OpenAI (must be securely stored in the backend).

Data Flow:

User sends a message in the frontend.

The frontend calls a REST endpoint in the backend (/chat).

The backend sends this message to OpenAI's API.

The OpenAI API returns a response.

The backend sends the response back to the frontend.

The frontend displays the chatbot's reply.

Environment Configuration:

Uses .env file or application.properties in Spring Boot to store the OpenAI API key.

Ensures separation of sensitive data and source code.

Security Considerations:

API keys are never exposed to the frontend.

CORS is configured in the backend to allow requests only from trusted origins.

Benefits of This Architecture:

Clear separation of concerns (frontend, backend, API).

Scalable and modular: easily extend features like authentication or logging.

Modern tech stack: useful for real-world enterprise-level applications.

Deployment (Optional Step):

Frontend can be deployed using Vercel, Netlify, or any static site host.

Backend can be hosted on platforms like Heroku, Render, or any cloud server.

Environment variables must be set properly in the production environment.

Use Cases:

Customer support bots.

Educational chat assistants.

Mental wellness companions.

Automated Q&A systems.

Learning Outcome:

Understanding of full-stack integration.

Practical experience with API consumption.

Real-world exposure to OpenAI's GPT models.

Skills in state management, HTTP communication, and secure API handling.
